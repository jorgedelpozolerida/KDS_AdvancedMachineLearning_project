# Task: Model how the brain represents visual information
{Central problem, domain}

## Goals

## The dataset
{data characteristics}

# Methods
{Central method: chosen architecture and training mechanisms, with a brief justification if non-standard}

# Experiments & results
{present and explain results, e.g. in simple accuracy tables over error graphs up to visualisations of representations and/or edge cases â€“ keep it crisp}

# Discussion
{summarise the most important results and lessons learned (what is good, what can be improved)}
