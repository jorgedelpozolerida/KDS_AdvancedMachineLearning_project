I tried the following setups:


Job ID = 128806

module load Python/3.8.6-GCCcore-10.2.0
module load CUDA/11.1.1-GCC-10.2.0 

Install all requirements, including tensorflow-gpu==2.9
Everything installs, however:

TEST RESULTS:
TensorFlow version: 2.9.0
CUDA not available



Job ID = 128822

module load TensorFlow/2.3.1-fosscuda-2020a-Python-3.8.2

TF 2.3.1

Changes to requirements. Uses requirements_eff.txt instead. Run setup_eff.job
Matplotlib asks for Numpy 2.0, but that's not a part of the module.
Try to downgrade matplotlib to 3.3.3 (Chat says this version is compatible with numpy < 2.0)

In model.py
from keras.applications import EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB5

Changed to
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB5
